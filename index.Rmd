I am a climate science PhD student and investigate recent ocean heat content changes using a numerical global ocean-sea ice model. Ocean heat content is a critical metric in our climate system as the ocean absorbed over 90% of the additional energy in the Earthâ€™s climate system since 1970. Ocean warming affects coastal communities through sea level rise, creates ecological stress for marine ecosystems, affects global fisheries and changes the occurrence of extreme weather events. 

Both my Bachelor's in Earth Sciences and Master's in Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich provided me with invaluable data analysis tools and an in-depth understanding of the complexities within our climate system. 

As part of my PhD and a ship-based research effort, I envision myself stepping onto the Antarctic continent.
