I am a climate science PhD student at the University of New South Wales and have a passionate interest in the role of the ocean's heat content in a warming climate. This is of great importance as over 90% of our human-induced warming signal ends up in the ocean and leads to rising sea levels, changes in the circulation, large-scale sea ice decline and ice shelf instabilities.

Both my Bachelor's in Earth Sciences and Master's in Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich provided me with invaluable data analysis tools and an in-depth understanding of the complexities within our climate system. This enabled me to undergo my current research position at the Climate Change Research Centre.

As part of my PhD and a ship-based research effort, I envision myself stepping onto the Antarctic continent.
